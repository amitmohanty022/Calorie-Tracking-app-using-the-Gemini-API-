# Calorie-Tracking-app-using-the-Gemini-API-

1. User Interface Setup:
The app is built using Streamlit and provides a simple, user-friendly interface. The homepage displays an input prompt field where users can type the name of the food or upload an image of their meal.

2. Image Upload and Processing:
Users can upload an image of their food by either dragging and dropping it into the designated area or browsing files from their device. The uploaded image is displayed on the screen for confirmation.

3. Input Prompt Option:
Alternatively, users can type a description of the food item in the "Input Prompt" field. This is useful if the user prefers text input over image uploads.
Image Analysis using Gemini API:

4. When an image is uploaded, the app processes it using the Gemini API. The API analyzes the image to identify the food items present in the image. If text input is used, the API directly processes the text.

5. Nutritional Information Retrieval:
Once the food items are identified, the app sends a request to the Gemini API to retrieve detailed nutritional information, including the number of calories for each identified food item.
   
6. Displaying Results:
The app displays the nutritional breakdown on the same page. It lists the food items identified (e.g., pizza, tomatoes, olives) along with their respective calorie counts.

7. Total Calorie Calculation:
The app sums up the calories from all the identified food items and displays the total calorie count at the bottom. In this case, the total is shown as "637 calories."

8. Health Advice:
The app also provides a brief health recommendation based on the identified food. For example, it might indicate that a food item like pizza is high in calories and unhealthy fats, suggesting users should consume it in moderation.
